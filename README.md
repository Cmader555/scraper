# Friend Finder

Classic Friend finder app that function's like a dating app where a user answers a series of questions. Those answers are then compared to the answers of pre-made "users", and the user receives their closest match. 
This app is a slight twist on the classic friend finder app, where all of the matches are different characters that Arnold Schwarzenegger has played.
